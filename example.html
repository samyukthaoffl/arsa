    <h1>Introduction to Machine Learning </h1>
    <p>Machine Learning is nothing but making machines learn and think and act like humans.
    <br> It is the process of enabling machines to learn from past experiences and to improve the accuracy of outputs over time. 
    <br> is hard for anyone to program each and every task, right? But with Machine Learning, you do not need to program each task; instead, the computer itself develops an algorithm according to the task to be performed using the available data.</p>
