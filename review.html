        <h4> HIGHS</h4>
    <p style="font-weight: normal;">Still looks exotic after all these years, V-12 pulls at our heartstrings, drives like a big ballet dancer.
        <h4>LOWS</h4>
       <p style="font-weight: normal;"> Transmission can be tough to tolerate, removing the roadster's roof is a hassle, cabin storage is almost nonexistent.
        <h4>VERDICT</h4>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The final Aventador is a flamboyant, loud, and positively glorious hyper car.</p>
        <p style="font-size: small;">BY <span style="color: blue;">ERIC STAFFORD</span> 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">With a raucous 769-hp V-12 engine and an exotic exterior, the <span style="color: blue;"><u>2022 Lamborghini Aventador</u> </span>is the definition of a hyper car. While competitors such as the<span style="color: blue;"> <u>Ferrari SF90 </u></span>embrace an electrified future, the <span style="color: blue;"><u>Lambo's</u></span> 12-cylinder mill swills fuel like a frat bro chugs a beer. Its scissor doors, wide and low proportions, and heavily vented bodywork double as a theater on wheels that's perpetually playing the Fast and Furious movies. Inside, its highly customizable cabin has room for two riders, but there's very little space to store loose items. Behind the wheel, the driver can activate the Aventador's shrieking soundtrack with a stab of their right foot or experience the massive machine's surprising agility by twirling the tiller. While its obsolete automatic transmission is almost as frustrating as the roadster's cumbersome roof removal, those are but a small penance for the 2022 Aventador's otherwise awesome powers and unmistakable style</p>

     <h4> HIGHS</h4>
    <p style="font-weight: normal;">Retro looks pay homage to an icon, insanely-quick acceleration, more comfortable inside than the original.
        <h4>LOWS</h4>
       <p style="font-weight: normal;"> Eye-watering price tag, only 112 will be made, not quite as charming as the original.
        <h4>VERDICT</h4>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">The limited-run 2022 Countach is a love letter to the original, but it's missing the quirkiness that made its forbear famous.
<p style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: blue;">ERIC STAFFORD</span></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p style="font-weight: normal;">A legendary name in supercar history returns in the form of the retro-inspired, limited-edition 2022 Lamborghini Countach. While it's essentially a re-bodied <span style="color: blue;"><u>Aventador</u></span> with the heart and soul of a Si√°n, the Italian automaker did an incredible job recreating the original's iconic design for modern audiences. The reinvented wedge lacks the original's pop-up headlights and the massive rear wing that adorned it in its twilight years, but the trademark hexagonal wheel arches and scissor doors are both present. Unlike the old Countach, the new one features a small electric motor powered by a supercapacitor that teams with a mighty mid-mounted V-12 to generate a combined 802 horsepower. Lamborghini claims this powertrain will help it achieve zero-to-62 mph in 2.8 seconds and a 221-mph top speed. Before anyone texts their Swiss banker about a seven-figure wire transfer, all 112 copies of the 2022 Countach have already been spoken for.
