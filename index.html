    <h1> Introduction to Machine Learning </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Machine Learning is nothing but making machines learn and think and act like humans. It is the process of enabling machines to learn from past experiences and to improve the accuracy of outputs over time. It is hard for anyone to program each and every task, right? But with Machine Learning, you do not need to program each task; instead, the computer itself develops an algorithm according to the task to be performed using the available data.</p>

    <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Machine learning is the practice of programming computers to learn from data. In the above example, the program will easily be able to determine if given are important or are “spam”. In machine learning, data referred to as called training sets or examples. </p>

    

    <h2>Why machine learning? </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Let’s assume that you'd like to write the filter program without using machine learning methods. In this case, you would have to carry out the following steps: <br> 
        ∙ In the beginning, you'd take a look at what spam e-mails looks like. You might select them for the words or phrases they use, like “debit card,” “free,” and so on, and also from patterns that are used in the sender’s name or in the body of the email <br>
        ∙ Second, you'd write an algorithm to detect the patterns that you've seen, and then the software would flag emails as spam if a certain number of those patterns are detected. <br>
        ∙ Finally, you'd test the program, and then redo the first two steps again until the results are good enough. <br>
        Because the program is not software, it contains a very long list of rules that are difficult to maintain. But if you developed the same software using ML, you'll be able to maintain it properly. 
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Systems of Machine Learning </h2>
    
    <p>There are different types of machine-learning systems. We can divide them into categories, depending&nbsp;on&nbsp;whether </p>
